And he twice hugged Aelius Lamia.</p><p>"It's certainly good to see you again," he said. "Alas, you remind me of the old days, when I was procurator of Judea in the province of Syria. I saw you for the first time thirty years ago. It was in Caesarea where you came to drag out the vexations of your exile. I was quite happy to mitigate them somewhat, and you, out of friendship, Lamia, followed me to that sad Jerusalem where the Jews filled me to the brim with bitterness and disgust. You stayed as my guest and my companion for more than ten years, and we both of us, talking of Rome, consoled ourselves, you for your misfortunes, me for my promotions."</p><p>Lamia again embraced him.</p></div> </div>
